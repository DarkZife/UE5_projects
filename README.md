# Overview

I am trying to learn more about UE5 and developing games in it. This is just a 2d version. I want to learn more about UE5 because I like the layout and designing it was really cool!

My game is a 2d side scroller, and thats about it( I would love to create a game like terraria, or a stardew valley(not a 2d version of this tho)

Like every other week, I really want to make video games, and this was really fun to dive into UE5

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

This was made just in UE5, if making the pixel art you could use Photoshop, I also used youtube to learn.

We used flipbooks, blueprints, and furthur into blueprints about character movement, tilesheets, props, using the camera, and etc.

# Useful Websites

{Make a list of websites that you found helpful in this project}
* [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5)
* [Youtube Cobra Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g31NTpq9p-o&ab_channel=CobraCode)

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Make an actual objective for the game, instead of just running around.
* Other characters you can talk to/have a dialogue, and they move around
* More to the map and the layout, as well to keep it a box so you cant fly out to no where
* More moveable things, so animals actually moving, moving platforms, etc
* A inventory system
* a second map you can load into
* and etc, there is a lot more I want to learn in UE5
